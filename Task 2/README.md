- **Multi-Page Architecture**: A structured website with a main landing page and four dedicated, detailed pages for each internship course.
- **Custom Mouse Follower**: An interactive cursor that enhances user engagement and provides visual feedback when hovering over links and buttons.
- **"Glassmorphism" Scrolling Navbar**: A semi-transparent, blurred navbar that floats over the content and elegantly transitions to a solid background on scroll.
- **Dynamic Hero Section**: Features a parallax background effect and an automated typing animation for the main headline.
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: Content sections gracefully fade and slide into view as the user scrolls down the page.
- **Auto-Sliding Testimonial Carousel**: A constantly changing review slider that showcases testimonials with smooth transitions and manual override controls.
- **Interactive Course Registration Forms**: Each course page includes a registration form that provides instant front-end confirmation upon submission, simulating a real user enrollment flow.
- **Custom-Styled Form Elements**: Includes a custom-designed dropdown menu that matches the website's theme for a consistent user experience.
