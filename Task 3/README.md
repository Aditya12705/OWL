# ü¶â Owl AI - Internship & Project Platform

A comprehensive, full-stack MERN-like (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js-style Python/Flask) platform designed to connect users with internships and projects. This application features distinct dashboards and functionalities for both regular users and administrators.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Owl AI provides a seamless experience for both applicants and administrators, with a feature-rich environment tailored to each role.

### üë§ User Features

- **Detailed Listings**: Users can view in-depth details for each project and internship, including description, tech stack, features, implementation guides, and timelines.
- **Application System**: A streamlined application process allows users to apply by submitting their name, email, and a PDF resume.
- **Application Tracking**: The dashboard's "Applied" section lets users track the real-time status of their applications (Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Completed).
- **Work Submission Portal**: Once an application is approved by an admin, the user gains access to a form to submit their work, including GitHub repositories, live demo URLs, and documentation links.
- **Animated UI**: The interface is brought to life with framer-motion for smooth animations and tsparticles for an engaging background effect.

### üõ°Ô∏è Admin Features

- **Dedicated Admin Dashboard**: A separate, secure dashboard for administrators to manage the entire platform.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js & npm (or yarn)
- Python 3 & pip
- MongoDB (either running locally or via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/owl-ai-platform.git
cd owl-ai-platform/backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your configuration
# (see the Environment Variables section below)

# Run the Flask server
flask run
```

The backend will now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory in a new terminal
cd ../frontend

# Install npm packages
npm install

# Run the React development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will now be running on http://localhost:5173.

## Environment Variables

For the backend to connect to the database and manage JWTs, you need to create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

```env
# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/owl_db"

# A strong, secret key for JWT encryption
JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-key-that-is-long-and-random"
```
